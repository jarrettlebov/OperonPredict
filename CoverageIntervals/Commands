# Prepare reads for visualization on IGV
## Sort and index bam file 
```{bash, eval = F}
cd "$Align_dir"
samtools sort mapped_K12_directRNA.bam -o sorted_mapped_K12_directRNA.bam
samtools index sorted_mapped_K12_directRNA.bam
```
## Isolate forward and reverse strand reads
```{bash, eval = F}
cd "$Align_dir"
samtools view -F 4 -F 16 -o f_sorted_mapped_K12_directRNA.bam sorted_mapped_K12_directRNA.bam
samtools view -f 16 -o r_sorted_mapped_K12_directRNA.bam sorted_mapped_K12_directRNA.bam
```
## Index reads
```{bash, eval = F}
cd "$Align_dir"
samtools index f_sorted_mapped_K12_directRNA.bam
samtools index r_sorted_mapped_K12_directRNA.bam
```
# Determine coverage at each position in the genome
```{bash, eval = F}
cd "$Align_dir"
samtools depth -aa f_sorted_mapped_K12_directRNA.bam > f_coverage.txt
samtools depth -aa r_sorted_mapped_K12_directRNA.bam > r_coverage.txt

## Determine coverage at all non-zero positions (this might require a grep -v "0")
```{bash, eval = F}
samtools depth f_sorted_mapped_K12_directRNA.bam > f_non0coverage.txt
samtools depth r_sorted_mapped_K12_directRNA.bam > r_non0coverage.txt
```
## Isolate only the positions column
```{bash, eval = F}
cd $Align_dir
cut -f2 f_non0coverage.txt > f_non0pos.txt
cut -f2 r_non0coverage.txt > r_non0pos.txt
```
# Define intervals with coverage
## Invoke python script which isolates intervals with read coverage and excludes regions without coverage
```{bash, eval = F}
python $Scripts/non0CovInter.py f_non0pos.txt > f_covinter.txt
python $Scripts/non0CovInter.py r_non0pos.txt > r_covinter.txt
```
